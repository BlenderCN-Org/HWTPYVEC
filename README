Python Vector Art Utilities for 3d

Blender Import AI and PDF Addon
To install it: 

 * Make sure you have a recent build of Blender 2.56 from graphicall.org
   (build 35333 or later works)
 * Find your blender installation's addons directory
   (something like 2.56/scripts/addons under wherever you installed blender)
   and make an io_vector dir
 * Use the tobl to copy the required files to io_vector (and rename the init file);
   you'll need to edit the script to put the right destination in
 * Start Blender, go to user Preferences, and enable Import-Export: Vector import

To use it:
 * From Blender's File menu, select Import > Vector files (.ai, .pdf)
 * Select an Adobe Illustrator (any version should work) or PDF file
   that contains some shapes
 * Perhaps change some of the Import Options in the tool panel for this addon.  Current options:
   o Smoothness: the bigger the number, the closer the approximation to curves by line segments
   o Scale: the number of Blender units for the longest side of the converted art
   o Subdivision:
     + Uniform: divide in half 'smoothness' times
     + Adaptive: like Uniform, but divide until curves are flat enough
     + Even: divide both curves and lines to try to make segments of uniform length
   o Filled paths only: ignore paths that aren't filled
   o Ignore white-filled: ignore paths that are filled with white (probably the background)
   o Combine paths: look at all paths together to decide where the holes are (will be slower)
   o Use colors: use the fill colors of solidly filled paths to make Blender materials
     for those polygons
   o Extrude depth: if you want the polygons extruded, set this > 0
   o Bevel amount: if you want the polygons beveled, set this > 0
   o Bevel pitch: if beveling, this is the number of degrees from
     horizontal that the bevel sides pitch up

Version history:
0.6: (TBD) Added display of number of vertices and faces.
  Added cap_back option for capping the back.
  Changed object name to be file name without extension.
0.5: (3/25/11) Added bevel and extrude.  Bevel only works until
  first 'edge event'. Changed to Object, Action, Settings interaction
  mode, but still buggy (need to select file from a panel property
  and need to change some other parameter before anything happens).
0.4: (3/14/11) Added even subdivision and initial color support
0.3: (3/8/11) Added adapative subdivision and ability to work with
  non-filled paths, and to combine multiple paths if desired
0.2: (3/7/11) Changed registration to work with later API.
0.1: (3/2/11) Initial version.  Uniform subdivision, filled paths only.
