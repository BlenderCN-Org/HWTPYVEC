Python Vector Art Utilities for 3d

Blender Import AI and PDF Addon
To install it: 

 * Make sure you have a recent build of Blender 2.56 from graphicall.org (build 35333 or later works)
 * Find your blender installation's addons directory (something like 2.56/scripts/addons under wherever you installed blender and make an io_vector dir
 * Use the tobl to copy the required files to io_vector (and rename the init file); you'll need to edit the script to put the right destination in
 * Start Blender, go to user Preferences, and enable Import-Export: Vector import

To use it:
 * From Blender's File menu, select Import > Vector files (.ai, .pdf)
 * Perhaps change some of the Import Options in the tool panel for this addon.  Current options:
   o Smoothness: the bigger the number, the closer the approximation to curves by line segments
   o Scale: the number of Blender units for the longest side of the converted art
   o Subdivision:
     + Uniform: divide in half 'smoothness' times
     + Adaptive: like Uniform, but divide until curves are flat enough
     + Even: divide both curves and lines to try to make segments of uniform length
   o Filled paths only: ignore paths that aren't filled
   o Ignore white-filled: ignore paths that are filled with white (probably the background)
   o Combine paths: look at all paths together to decide where the holes are (will be slower)
   o Use colors: use the fill colors of solidly filled paths to make Blender materials for those polygons
 * Select an Adobe Illustrator (any version should work) or PDF file that contains some shapes and hit the 'Import Vector' button
